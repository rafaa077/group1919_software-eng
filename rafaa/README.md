How it Works:
A random number between 1 and 100 is generated when the page loads.
The user inputs a guess, and the script checks if it's too high, too low, or correct.
Feedback is displayed, and the user can keep guessing until they get it right.
The number of attempts is tracked and displayed upon a correct guess.
