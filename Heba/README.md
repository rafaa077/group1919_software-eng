TextingHow the Game Works:
HTML: Defines the structure of the game, including a container for the game area, a player (represented as a blue rectangle), and a ball (red circle).
CSS: Styles the game elements, including setting the dimensions of the game area, the player, and the ball.
JavaScript:
The player is controlled by moving the mouse left and right.
The ball falls from the top of the screen, and if it hits the player, the score increases by 1.
The ball resets to a random horizontal position once it reaches the bottom of the screen, and the player tries to catch it again.
The score is displayed at the bottom.
How to Play:
Move the mouse left and right to control the blue rectangle (the player).
Try to catch the falling red ball.
Each time you catch the ball, your score increases.
Improving the Game:
You can expand this simple game by adding more features like:

Increasing the speed of the ball over time.
Adding a game-over condition.
Adding sound effects when the player catches the ball.
Adding a timer for a timed game.
